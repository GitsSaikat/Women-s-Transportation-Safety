# Women's-Transportation-Safety

This project tries to identify women's perceptions of transportation safety. From the finalized model we can gain insight into how women don't feel safe using various modes of public transportation. In this project we preprocessed the dataset, formed a safety score, and based on assigned the instances of the label, then we further visualized multiple aspects of the dataset with the Perceived Safety Column. After that, we split the dataset into train set and test set where the split ratio was 80/20. Then we trained our model using Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, KNN, and Decision Tree Classifier. Among them Random Forest Classifier showed the best performance. So we chose this classifier for hyperparameter tuning. First, we used random search to find the best parameters, and then we used Grid Search, taking the best parameter from the Random Search and Extending them by taking nearby parameters of the best parameter in the parameter grid and Applying Grid Search on this parameter grid and improved the performance of the classifier. After that, we used LIME to interpret why our model predict what it predict.
